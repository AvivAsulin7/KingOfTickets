# King Of Tickets

<h2>Here We Go ! Come to sell and buy safely tickets to your events! (Sport,Entertaiment,Concerts and more)</h2>

Me and my partner proudly present our final project from our studies as part of BSc Computer Science—a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed for external entrepreneurs. In response to the prevalent issues of cheating, scams, and unreliable brokers in the second-hand ticket market, we have developed a secure and trustworthy application. Our solution provides a unique set of features that instills confidence in both buyers and sellers. However, please note that due to confidentiality agreements and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), the code uploaded here is partial and does not include certain proprietary features. Thank you for your understanding, and we hope you find value in exploring our project.

✅ Search engine with filter functionality. <br>
✅ Service for receiving purchased tickets via email. <br>
✅ Identification of fake event tickets. <br>
✅ Prevention of brokering by restricting sellers from setting prices above the original ticket price. <br>

NOTE:More confidential features that can be discussed will be present in a job interview.
